We're just going to go through the motions of how this platform works.
as System Admin agent, we can look at these tickets, reassign them, even with comments and reasoning if you should decide to. We can also change SLA plans on the fly.  It's a very useful system to have.  It is good practice to assign tickets to teams, with agents assigned to said teams, rather than to assign any one agent directly.

Pictured above is what the ticket system looks like to a non-user, such as a temp employee or a customer

When a ticket is submitted, it then becomes visible to whomever is granted access, and an admin can change those parameters as one sees fit.

As you can see here, 2 of the tickets made have been assigned to Jon Doe.

Also as an administrator, you can change default ticket settings per department, such as who is in charge, whether that dept.s tickets can be austo claimed or auto assigned, and how responses are handled.

Tickets can be reassigned to other agents as an agent,so in the case of needing help or collaboration it can be passed around, as well as a space for notes for whomever it gets reassigned to.

You can also change SLA plans as needed for your employees, with tips or reasonings as desired attached

That's basically it.  You should know how to use osTicket now.
